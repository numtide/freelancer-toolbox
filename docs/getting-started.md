# Getting Started as a Freelancer

This guide covers the essential steps to set yourself up as an independent contractor.

Becoming a contractor is a bit like growing up. You get to take more risks and also get more independence and freedom.

## Requirements

### Tax Registration

Each contractor must register with their respective country's tax system, either as a freelancer or by creating a corporation. The process varies by country but typically involves:

- Registering your business with tax authorities
- Obtaining a tax identification number
- Understanding VAT/sales tax obligations
- Setting up proper invoicing

See [Country Guides](./countries/) for specific requirements in your location.

### Health Insurance

Health insurance requirements and options vary significantly by country. Some have mandatory public systems, others have private markets, and some have hybrid approaches.

Check your [country guide](./countries/) for specific recommendations.

### Personal Website and Email

To stand out as a contractor, establish your own website and professional email address. Publishing blog posts about your work and learnings helps build your reputation.

Having a visible independent business presence also helps with legal classification - in many countries, appearing as a genuine independent business (rather than a disguised employee) is important for tax and social security purposes.

## Recommendations

### Business Bank Account

Open a bank account separate from your private account. This simplifies accounting since you don't mix private and business expenses. Tax consultants may charge extra for sorting through personal transactions.

[Wise](https://wise.com) is a popular choice for freelancers:
- Multi-currency support
- Competitive exchange rates
- API access (integrates with this toolbox via [wise-exporter](../wise-exporter/))
- Debit card available
- Works internationally

### Accounting Software

Accounting software helps track expenses, write and manage invoices, and match bank transactions with income/expenses. Good software can parse PDF invoices automatically.

Choose software compatible with your local tax laws (VAT, income tax reports). See your [country guide](./countries/) for recommendations specific to your location.

## Work-Life Balance

In order to maintain a healthy lifestyle, consider separating your work and personal identities. Use different email addresses for work and personal communications.

Make sure you don't burn yourself out!
