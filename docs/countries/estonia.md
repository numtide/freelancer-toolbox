## e-Residency

Estonia's e-Residency program allows non-residents to establish and manage an EU-based company remotely. It provides a digital identity and access to Estonian government services, but it is **not** actual residency in Estonia.

### Who should consider an Estonian company?

An Estonian company makes sense if you:
- Are resident in Estonia, or
- Live outside the EU but need access to the European market

In these cases, consult an accountant and open a proper company.

### Finding an accountant

Estonian accounting for small companies is straightforward, so specific recommendations aren't critical - accountants also change frequently (acquisitions, etc.). Search online and find someone that looks credible.

### Who should avoid e-Residency?

If you already have residency in another EU country, be cautious. Your country of residence may claim that your company has its "permanent establishment" there rather than in Estonia - especially if you are the sole owner and conduct most business activities from your home country.

For example, if you live in Spain and own an Estonian company as a single owner, Spanish tax authorities could argue the company is effectively Spanish and should be taxed accordingly.

**Recommendation:** If you're already an EU resident, forming a company in your country of residence is typically safer from a tax compliance perspective.

### Banking

If you're an Estonian resident, any of the regular Estonian banks work fine - they're all offered as options during the online company formation process and are more or less equivalent.

For e-Residency (non-resident) companies, banking is more difficult. Most traditional banks are reluctant to open accounts unless you have substantial business in Estonia. Some may charge special fees. For basic needs, a [Wise](https://wise.com) business account may be sufficient.
