# Harvest invoice calculator

Create your invoice based on [Harvest](https://numtide.harvestapp.com) timesheets
and calculate the exchange rate to your currency using [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com).

Optional: generate invoice using Sevdesk

## Requirements

Generate your personal access token in Harvest using [this page](https://id.getharvest.com/oauth2/access_tokens/new).

```console

```

Save your Account ID and your token in `.envrc.local`

## Usage / Examples

* Generate for the current month

```console

```console
harvest-exporter --month 3
```

* Filter by user

```console
harvest-exporter --user "Hans Maier"
```

```console
harvest-exporter --format json
```

* Generate using other currency

```console

```
harvest-exporter  --hourly-rate 100
```

This will override the hourly rate reported by harvest prior to applying the nutmide rate.

This can be also used to export hours for clients that are external to numtide (client name starting with "External -")

Generate a bill from the harvest exprt for the customer with the ID 1000

```

  For income tax in Germany one can claim money back for each day. The time report can be obtained from [here](https://numtide.harvestapp.com/reports) for each user.
  Than run this script:


``` console
$ working-days-calculator report.csv
