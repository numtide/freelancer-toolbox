## e-Residency

Estonia's e-Residency program allows non-residents to establish and manage an EU-based company remotely.

Consider [Xolo.io](https://www.xolo.io/zz-en/go) for e-Residency-based freelancing. They provide:
- Company formation
- Accounting services
- Banking integration
- Tax compliance

This can be useful for freelancers who:
- Want an EU company without physically relocating
- Work with international clients
- Need simplified cross-border invoicing
